### Introduction
This is an image processing application implemented in C++ with a Qt desktop interface. The application offers various functionalities related to image manipulation and analysis.

### Project Features
The application provides the following features:

- [x] Adding different types of noise to images:
 - Salt and Pepper noise
 - Uniform noise
 - Gaussian noise
 - Applying different filters:
 - Average filter
 - Gaussian filter
 - Median filter
 - [x] Edge detection using:
 - Sobel edge detector
 - Roberts edge detector
 - Prewitt edge detector
 - Canny edge detector
 - [x] Drawing histograms and distribution curves for uploaded images
 - Image equalization and normalization
 - Local and global thresholding
 - plotting RGB histograms with cumulative curves
 - [x]Frequency domain filtering:
 - Ideal Low Pass filter (smoothing)
 - Ideal High Pass filter (sharpening)
 - Creating hybrid images
